        My name is Joshua Jackson, and I am from Martha's Vineyard,MA. I moved to San Diego in the winter of 2016. I
        moved to this beautiful city to pursue a career in restaurant management but had no idea i would discover a
        passion that I had forgot about as a child rummaging through Napster, Quake 2 and burning cd's for friends.

        Beginning in Hospitality, my passion for website development emerged as I have been in charge of programming
        MICROS POS for the restaurant group San Diego Dining Group. Without any formal education of the programming
        languages, I learned on a case by case basis with various technical issues. From order entries being locked in  the database, connecting the correct IP address to POS terminals, server connectivity issues, menu programming and efficency adjustments to ensure more enjoyable experiences, revealed a passion and potentional im excited to
        offer to many more.
